 ðŸ‘‹ Hi There,
-  Life is a one on one game with yourself. You either lose and learn or win and learn and the next day you try again. I have taken a lot of losses but I have learned from all of them. Unfortunately not everyone is so lucky. Growing up in Boston you get to be exposed to a lot of different cultures. I have seen a lot of my friends have to grow up too fast. One year we are all turning 13 years old; next year Iâ€™m turning 14 years old, while they are going on 20 years old. Through this experience I realized how privileged I am in comparison to them. It has always made me work harder and strive for excellence, not worry about what the next person has and pull people along with me. I started learning about coding through YouTube tutorials and fell in love ever since. Through coding I got to help bridge the gap between different minded people. The wonderful people at Resilient Coders helped shape me into the Full Stack software engineer I am today. I would love the opportunity to bring my work ethic and creativity to help grow your business and make a great impact on your businesses culture.
